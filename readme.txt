Adds a one-click real-time mood rating widget to all of your posts.  The PRO version includes the ability to customize your moods and color choices.

== Description ==

MoodThingy is a widget that any blogger can use to track the emotional feedback of an individual blog post or article. The widget can be configured to automatically appear below all of your posts, or manually placed anywhere within a post using a handy WordPress tag. A dashboard of MoodThingy stats is also offered so you can see which articles excite, amuse, or bore your readers, sorted by mood or number of votes in the past day, week, or month.

A WordPress Widget is also included in the plug-in as a way to show readers the most popular blog posts in the past day, week, month or year. The PRO version allows publishers to customize the moods and colors of the plug-in for their blog.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip the plugin file.
2. Upload the "moodthingy" folder into your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins section of your WordPress admin and activate the MoodThingy plugin.
4. And you're done!
